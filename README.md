# BlueMap-Essentials-WarpsOnly
BlueMap integration for Essentials

This is a fork of pop4959's BlueMap Essentials addon without homes.
The reson for this is i used the resource as-is but i did not want the home functions, when disabling homes in the config the slider remains in BlueMap's sidebar.

If you are migrating from the origional resource by pop4959 you need to remove your "markers.json"
This file is located in "ServerMainDirectory/BlueMap/web/data"

This fork has been stripped of all the home functions and had its warp portal image replaced with the image seen below.
